# IWT Basic Project — Medi-Caps University (3rd Semester)

This repository contains my basic Internet & Web Technology (IWT) project from my B.Tech (3rd semester) at **Medi-Caps University**.

I'm re-adding it here because a few things I built earlier got lost. Keeping this project documented reminds me of my progress and skill development — from the first HTML/CSS pages to wiring simple JavaScript interactions.

> **Why this repo matters to me:** it's a snapshot of where I started, the fundamentals I learned, and the confidence I built shipping a working web project.



    ## Project Overview

    A static website built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and a bit of **JavaScript** (as covered in IWT). The focus was on clean structure, basic components, and simple interactivity.

    ### What I learned / Skills reflected
    - Semantic HTML structure
- Custom CSS styling
- Introductory JavaScript event handling

    ## Repo Structure (key files)


| File                           | HTML <title>   | Inferred Purpose   |
|:-------------------------------|:---------------|:-------------------|
| IWT.github.io-master/First.css | -              | Core page / asset  |


## How to View/Run
1. Download/clone this repository.
2. Open `index.html` (or the main HTML file) directly in your browser.
3. For JS/CSS to load correctly, keep the folder structure intact.

> No server required — it's a static project.



## Restored Items
I added back pieces that went missing earlier (HTML sections, CSS tweaks, or small JS utilities). This README documents them so I can track how the project evolved from the original submission.
