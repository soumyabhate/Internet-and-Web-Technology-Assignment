# IWT Assignment — Medi-Caps University

**Student:** Soumya Bhate  
**Instructor:** Prof. Prashant Panse

This repository contains a basic Internet & Web Technology (IWT) project from my B.Tech (3rd semester) at **Medi-Caps University** where I was learning how to create a webpage via HTML and CSS. I'm re-adding it here because a few things I built earlier got lost. Keeping this project documented reminds me of my progress and skill development — from the first HTML/CSS pages to wiring simple JavaScript interactions.

> **This project is special to me because I built it from scratch—everything from adding HTML headers to choosing the colour palette for my About page—back when GPT wasn’t as popular as it is today.**

## Project Overview
A static website built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and a bit of **JavaScript** (as covered in IWT). The focus was on clean structure, basic components, and simple interactivity.

### What I learned / Skills reflected
- Semantic HTML structure
- Custom CSS styling
- Introductory JavaScript event handling

## Repo Structure (key files)

| File                           | HTML <title>   | Inferred Purpose   |
|:-------------------------------|:---------------|:-------------------|
| IWT.github.io-master/First.css | index.htm      | Core page / asset  |

## How to View/Run
1. Download/clone this repository.
2. Open `index.html` (or the main HTML file) directly in your browser.
3. For JS/CSS to load correctly, keep the folder structure intact.

> No server required — it's a static project.

## Restored Items
I added back the files that got deleted by mistake. This README documents everything from the original submission.
